# ML-Project

In this project, we have compare over 9 models which are :-
XGBoost
CatBoost
SVM (RBF,POLY)
LightBGM
Random Forest
BPANN
ANN
KNN
softmax regression 

The comparison clearly demonstrates that advanced ensemble learning models, particularly CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, are the most suitable choices for predicting consumer purchasing behavior in this dataset. These models provide superior predictive accuracy, robustness against noise, and better generalization capability, making them ideal candidates for real-world deployment in precision marketing and recommendation systems

Overall, the results demonstrate that advanced ensemble learning models are the most reliable and suitable choice for real-world purchasing intention prediction and precision marketing systems.
